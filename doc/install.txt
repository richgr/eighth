All installation was conducted as per:

1) Rails - RailsTutorial.org instructions (and in PDF)

2) Postgres - http://xtremekforever.blogspot.com/2011/05/setup-rails-project-with-postgresql-on.html



By the way

The RailsTutorial.org has some great instructions, but for quick re-install, try page 95 (97 of 515) in the discussion of RSpec possible solutions.

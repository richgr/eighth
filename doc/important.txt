All installation was conducted as per:

1) Rails - RailsTutorial.org instructions (and in PDF)

2) Postgres - http://xtremekforever.blogspot.com/2011/05/setup-rails-project-with-postgresql-on.html


3) To run the console, server or rake in different modes (dev, test, prod)
Check out p.220

rails c
rails console
rails console development
rails s
rails server
rails server --environment development
bundle exec rake db:migrate
bundle exec rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=development

rails console test
rails server --environment test
bundle exec rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=test

rails console production
rails server --environment production
bundle exec rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=production

4) When getting ready for a new database installation, try these:
bundle exec rake db:migrate
bundle exec rake db:test:prepare
bundle exec rake db:populate
bundle exec rake db:populate RAILS_ENV=test


5) Interested in a beep noise (after an RSpec call)?  Try this:

clear; time bin/rspec spec/ ; beep -f 261.6 -l 2


6) To precompile easily, try this:

clear; git rm -rf public/assets; bundle exec rake assets:precompile; beep;


By the way

The RailsTutorial.org has some great instructions, but for quick re-install, try page 95 (97 of 515) in the discussion of RSpec possible solutions.
